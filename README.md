# Expense Tracker v1.5

A simple expense tracker built with **Python (Tkinter)**.  
This is Phase 1.5 of my Python learning journey.  

## Features
- Add expenses with description and amount
- View expenses in a list
- Automatically calculates total expenses
- Saves expenses in `expenses.json` so data is not lost when you close the app

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Expense-tracker.git
